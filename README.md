# Findphone - A simple android application to find your phone which is lost temporarily.
Problem:
 It is a common scenario where you keep your phone somewhere and sound profile would be in silent/vibrate mode. Now you cannot find the phone even if you call your number from your friend's phone. 

Solution 1:
The one one solution everyone knows is to use google find my device: https://www.google.com/android/find
But the precondition here is that your phone should be connected to internet which is not always the case

My Solution:
You can setup a text message format like say,"wake me up now". Now whenever you send this message from any phone(improvements in progress), the phone will start ringing even if it is in vibrate mode.
